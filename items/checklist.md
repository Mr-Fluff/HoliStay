# Group Assignment Checklist
The following markdown document is a checklist of items you **should** complete before submission of your assignment. This exists to help you keep track of all the requirements you must fulfil.

## Git & Project Access
- [x] **GitLab**: Commits (as shown in the Git commit history) using your own account. Failing to do this may result in zero marks.
- [x] **GitLab**: Have the relevant marking tutors as 'maintainers' for your repository.
- [x] The markers will be able to login to your **App** via the APK using either of the 2 sets of accounts in the assignment specification.
- [x] If **Firebase** has been used, you have added the Marker's email to your Firebase project, and included the link to your Firebase project in your report.

## Documents (all non-android files) located in a folder named `items`
- [x] A conflict resolution protocol is documented and well-defined.
- [x] All Team Meeting Minutes (with links in the report). There must be at least 4 meetings among the team. See the [meeting template](./meeting0.md) for guidance on how to structure these if you have never done this before.

- [x] Have a markdown report document titled 'report.md'.
- [x] **Statement of Originality**: All members have read and signed the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml). Failure to do so will result in zero marks.
- [x] All external code, assets or help received outside the group is documented in the [statement of originality](./statement-of-originality.yml) and relevant parts in the code.
