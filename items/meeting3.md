## Meeting Minutes
- Completed tasks:
1) Completed AVl tree for price
2) Singleton design pattern for custom login


- Features to be implemented immediately such as:
1) Search for information in app using tokenizer and parser and tree

- Design Patterns chosen:
1) State - Booking process
2) Observer - user notifications
3) Singleton - custom login

- Data Structures chosen:
1) AVL Tree - for storing and retrieving data [Reason:Search function takes less time than BST, Addition of new values to dataset is not frequent]

- Clean and choose meaningful dataset attributes while limiting it to 2500 instances
- Upload dataset to Cloud Firestore and display retrieved data on recycler view
